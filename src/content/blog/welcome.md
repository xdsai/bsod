# Welcome

This is the first post on my BSOD-themed blog. If you're reading this, you've successfully navigated the retro interface!

## Why BSOD?

I wanted to create something unique and nostalgic. The Windows Blue Screen of Death is iconic, and building a portfolio around it felt like a fun challenge.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Web development
- Cool projects I'm working on
- Technical deep-dives
- Whatever else interests me

Thanks for visiting!
